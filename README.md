This program is the game rush hour, in which the user inputs a board file along with which car they want to move, 
how much they want to move it, and in which direction they want to move the car. If the car is not on the board, 
the user informed so and is prompted to enter another car, direction, and how much to move. Furthermore, if the user 
wants to move the car more than is possible, the car is not moved. If the user manages to move the red car on the left 
side of the next to exit, the user wins the game and the message is displayed.
